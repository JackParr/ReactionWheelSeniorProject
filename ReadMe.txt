Hello!
I am surprised if anyone ever reads this file, including my professors or partner. If you do, let me know and I owe you $5! 

Anyway, the way this is set up is you must install all 3 files for the program to run correctly. The program is not wonderfully optimized, but it does run. The first step is to run the file titled "SimulinkSetupData.m", which should set up important variables for the data involved, then run the simulink file titled "ReactionWheelSimulink.slxc", finally to display your output run "SimulinkProcessData.m" which should plot your data and give final outputs for your data. 

If you do have any questions about this file, email jtp401@msstate.edu. I am about to graduate, so maybe in the future it should be jacktparr@outlook.com.

Have fun and good luck!
